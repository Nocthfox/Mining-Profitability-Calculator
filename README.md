# Mining Profitability Calculator

A python project that develop a tool that calculates the profitability of cryptocurrency mining based on hardware specifications and electricity costs.


When using the code, make sure to update the example usage section with the appropriate values for ```mining_hardware```, ```electricity_cost```, ```mining_difficulty```, and ```pool_fee```. Adjust the values according to the specific mining hardware, electricity cost, mining difficulty, and pool fee you want to use in your calculations.


__Required Libraries:__

1. ```hashlib```: This library is a built-in library in Python and does not require any additional installation.
2. ```ecdsa```: You may need to install the ecdsa library to work with Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for key generation and signing. You can install it using the following command
   ```bash
   pip install ecdsa
   ```
3. Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended) before installing the libraries.
4. Please note that the modified code does not explicitly require the ```web3``` or ```ccxt``` libraries mentioned in the project. If you need to interact with the Ethereum network or connect to specific cryptocurrency exchanges, you may need to install the ```web3``` or ```ccxt``` library separately, depending on your specific requirements.
